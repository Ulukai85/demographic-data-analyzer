This is a project I worked on for claiming the Data Analysis-Certificate. Instructions for building this project can be found here: [project specifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer)

I wrote the code for [demographic_data_analyzer.py](https://github.com/Ulukai85/demographic-data-analyzer/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py).

For this project imported a csv-file and had to get comfortable with pandas and the handling of DataFrames and Series. I tried to write readable one-liners if possible, but fell back to more explicit code for some tasks.
